# Dox on Box

Dox on Box reader is a reader application which incorporates Beeline technology to make a versatile iPad reader application.  It incorporates Linguistic analysis and pagination technology into a familiar page curl reader format.  It augments the base beeline functionality by adding dyslexic friendly font faces, and linguistic tagging to promote important words.  It also integrates Box, an online cloud document storage service, and allows you to browse and read your Box documents, including Google Docs files.

In addition, it can download any URL and can search wikipedia and display articles using all of this technology. 

This was built solely during iOS Dev Camp 2012.
